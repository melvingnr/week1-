# Church Connect+

Lightweight Django web app for small/mid-sized churches to centralize:
- **Prayer Requests** (CRUD + moderation; mark “answered”)
- **Youth Group Sign-Ups** (events + simple attendance log)
- **Tithes & Offerings** (Zelle link + optional webhook log)
- **Weekly Announcements** (single place for updates)
- **Weekly Report Export** (PDF)

## Why
Reduce admin overhead, increase youth participation, support secure digital giving, and keep the congregation informed in one accessible place.

## Working with AI
An LLM assisted with memo structure and the system diagram; I verified and edited all content.
